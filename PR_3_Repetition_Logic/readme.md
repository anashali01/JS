# 🔁 JavaScript Repetition Logic Project

Welcome to the **JavaScript Repetition Logic** project!  
This repository features 20 practical JS programs that demonstrate the use of loops (`for`, `while`, and `do...while`) for solving common computational problems. Each program is paired with a sample output screenshot for clarity.
